            <p>All encryption is handled client-side. Neither your passphrase nor any of your private information ever leaves your browser, workstation, or mobile device.</p>
            <p>FreeWallet passphrases are highly secure, and protect your wallet from any brute force attacks. They are also rather easy to learn and hard to mistype.</p>
